## [Testing](#testing)
Google Chrome's and Firefox's Development tools on local pc were constantly used to test changes I
made to project and to make sure its displaying correctly on all screen sizes.
I also used different mobile devices like phones, tablets and iPads for checking correct mobile responsivennes.

For code Validation:  
      
Forms and inputs are validated by django itself.    
Pep8 linter was helpful by highlighting syntax errors during development.    

---

## [Deployment](#deployment)

For my version control I used Github and Heroku for hosting the live project.

#### For local deployment: 

1. Open Terminal in the desired project directory of local maschine
2. Create and activate virtual environment if necessary.   
  ```python3 -m venv venv ```   
  ```source venv/bin/activate``` for linux maschine.
3. Enter folowing commands :   
```git clone https://github.com/mariourban83/milestone4-eshop.git ```  (will download and unpack the project)   
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. In the main project folder of the project directory, where settings.py lives, create  **.env** file and enter the following:

* SECRET_KEY = "your own key"  # Django app secret key
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "your own key"  # Amazon S3 
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "your own key"  # Amazon S3
* STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "your own key"  # Stripe
* STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "your own key"  # Stripe
* DATABASE_URL = "your own key"  # Postgres key from Heroku
* CLIENT_ID = "your own key"  #Paypal    
Replace the **"your own key"** value with your secret keys 

6. In the terminal, enter the folowing commands : 
* ``python manage.py makemigrations``
* ``python manage.py migrate``
* ``python manage.py createsuperuser``
* ``python manage.py runserver``    

In the browser, open http://127.0.0.1:8000  and the project should be now live and ready to use.


#### To deploy the project to Heroku

1. Create the app in Heroku.
2. Add ***Heroku Postgres*** free ***Hobby*** level in the ***Add-Ons*** section for serving postgres database.
3. Copy all variables (keys) from the  ***.env***  file located in the root folder of the project directory to the ***Config Vars*** section in Heroku->Project->Settings.
5. In Heroku->Project->Deploy section connect the github repository of the project and ***Enable Automatic Deploys*** from the master branch if thats the case. Otherwise, manual Deploy Branch option is available too.
5. Before Deploying the Branch, ***Procfile*** and updated ***requirements.txt*** files are necessary to be in the root dir of the folder.
6. If automatic deploys were selected, from now on the project updates after every commit to github.
7. If Deployement, build, went successfuly, restart the dynos in Heroku -> Project Section and project.
8. Allowed Hosts section in settings.py file should now be updated in order to serve the website.(Add deployed heroku project website address to the python ```ALLOWED_HOSTS``` dictionary ).
9. The project should be now visible to the public on the https address Heroku provides.    


The live version of this project deployed to Heroku can be found [here](https://lr-onlineshop.herokuapp.com/).
